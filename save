Hello All! I'm student of K L University. Our team got selected to Smart India Hackathon finals. We are working on a project which mainly deals with designing a Mobile application. This project is all about  making an mobile application on Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana. We are using JavaScript, Firebase and Ionic technologies for this project. We were asked to have a mentor for our team who have to guide us in the project. So we require a person who can guide and support us for the above project in the technologies stated. DM me on or before 27-03-2018 if any are interested. Will be very thankful for your support.
